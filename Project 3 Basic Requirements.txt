Getting Started
Please review and ensure these steps have been completed on your local machine already prior to starting the project.

You may use any OS to complete this work, and you may use a Jupyter Notebook to create the Python test scripts, if youâ€™d like.

Create a free Azure account. Use the Outlook email address. Please note you will need to provide a credit card to receive $200.00 in free credits. Your credit card will not be charged unless you exceed this amount. This should be plenty of credits for you to complete your project.

Create an Azure DevOps account (If needed, click "start" free under user licenses.)

Use cloud shell or Install Azure CLI.

Use your favorite text editor or IDE - for this I used VS Code. Install the VS Code extensions for Python and Terraform.

Configuration
Selenium
Download the latest Chrome driver. You will also need to add the chromedriver to PATH.

pip install -U selenium
sudo apt-get install -y chromium-browser
Execute the /automatedtesting/selenium/login.py file to open the demo site.

JMeter
Install JMeter.

Use JMeter to open the automatedtesting/jmeter/Starter.jmx file.

Replace the APPSERVICEURL with the URL of your AppService once it's deployed.

Import the automatedtesting/postman/StarterAPIs.json collection into Postman.
